# hapi-places
A hapi project, designed to teach us about Hapi servers, handlebars, and API requests.

# User Stories

When I click onto the site I am presented with information about a random city. I should be able to see the weather, price, internet, coffee price etc. I should be able to press buttons labelled 'warmer', 'cheaper', 'more internetier' etc to request another city.

# Tasks

- integrate nomadlist API + a flight API on the backend
- use templating engine on backend to send complete pages to front end
