# Stop Go Continue

## Stop
- Throughout the project our TDD use was relatively inconsistent. When used we saw noticable benefits. In future we should ensure that we use it more consistently.
- Making giant files. This related to the backend test file..

## Go
- Allow time for individual research.
- Modularise our tests.
- Switching pairs more often!
- Allow more time for team discussions throughout the day.

## Continue
- Using ES6 syntax when appropriate.
- Doing regular code reviews/explanations.
- TDD, (90% code cov yeah!)
- Investing time in planning and research.
- Scheduled Team Catchups.
- Build website with CSS towards the start of the project!
